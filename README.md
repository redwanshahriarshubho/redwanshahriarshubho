👋 Hi, I’m @redwanshahriarshubho

👀 I’m interested in technology, AI, and developing scalable software solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, FastAPI, Python, and Dart, while exploring Langchain for LLM integration and experimenting with advanced models like Flan-T5 and Phi-3. I also work with APIs like Tavily and DuckDuckGo.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that combine AI with practical applications, such as nutrition apps and full-stack web solutions.

😄 Pronouns: He

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you’ll find me listening to music or catching up on sleep
